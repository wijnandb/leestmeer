The murdered woman found in Terneuzen on 22 June of this year will be buried on Tuesday afternoon the 13th of August. “Unfortunately, no loved one of the victim will attend the funeral, only people who have a professional reason. We want to know who this woman is as soon as possible, so that we can inform her loved ones”, says public prosecutor Kim Weijers.
