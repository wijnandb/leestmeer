On Saturday 22 June 2019, at around noon,  a dead woman was found in a meadow on Sint Anthoniekade. This spot is located just a few metres before the Belgian border. This woman was killed in a crime. 
Despite a great deal of media attention, the identity of the victim is still not known. Neither are there any traces of the offender(s).
